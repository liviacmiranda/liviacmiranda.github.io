							Virtual Reality
						</header>
						<p>
							
							As much as virtual reality (VR) is not new, it has to be taken into account in the gaming sector,
								as it is gaining popularity and thanks to its advances in technology it will not be long before it reaches e-sports. 
							What experiences will be available to gamers owing to virtual reality? Virtual reality offers players a more 
							 immersive experience and opens up a whole world of possibilities in competitive gaming. Players will be able to hear 
							 sounds as if they were real life, view hand and arm movements, feel part of more realistic games and have the opportunity
							 to interact with other players.

							of their exercise program.
