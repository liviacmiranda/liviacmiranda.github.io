							Virtual Reality
						</header>
						<p>
							
							As much as virtual reality (VR) is not new, it has to be taken into account in the gaming sector,
								as it is gaining popularity and thanks to its advances in technology it will not be long before it reaches e-sports. 
							What experiences will be available to gamers owing to virtual reality? Virtual reality offers players a more 
							 immersive experience and opens up a whole world of possibilities in competitive gaming. Players will be able to hear 
							 sounds as if they were real life, view hand and arm movements, feel part of more realistic games and have the opportunity
							 to interact with other players.

							Heart monitor in training
						</header>
						<p>
							These devices play a huge role in progressing in a workout plan 
							if used to target certain heart rate. Without a heart monitor 
							it would be difficult for athletes to track progress and sustainability
							of their exercise program.

							Foil Surfing
						</header>
						<p>
							Foil surfing (or surf foiling) is the sport of riding a surfboard
							which has a hydrofoil attached to the board instead of a fin. 
							This allows the surfboard to fly above the water. 
							The surfer is essentially surfing the foil but riding the board.
							Foil surfing offers a whole new edge and excitement to surfing.
							After all, itâ€™s a completely different approach to riding waves 
							in that it allows you to ride above the waves.
