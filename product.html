							History of foiling
						</header>
						<p>
							The early development of hydrofoils started over 100 years ago
							when Italian Enrico Forlanini achieved 36.9 knots with his 60hp 
							airscrew-driven boat in 1906. Several engineers took notice, among
							them the Wright Brothers and Alexander Graham Bell, both of whom 
							experimented with foilborne craft.
							Within a few years speeds moved briskly into the 50-knot range
							for power boats, but it wasnâ€™t until 1938 that a sailing boat got up onto 
							foils with Americans Gilruth and Carl who managed to foil at five knots.
							Foils can be used to surf, race, or cruise around. One of the first watermen 
							to attach a foil to a surfboard was Laird Hamilton. He used it in big wave conditions
							and proved that it could be a smart and valuable weapon in all kinds of swells.

							What issues does foiling solve?
						</header>
						<p>
							Foil windsurfing makes it possible to enjoy windsurfing even in locations 
							where the wind is only blowing at 7 to 10 knots. Foiling is basically windsurfing
							in lighter wind conditions, which means you would have more time in the water!
							Foil windsurfing is also very low-risk and can be learned by everyone.

							How to foil surf
						</header>
						<p>
							It''s quite simple to understand the mechanics of foils. The process is similar to airplane 
							or birds' wings.
							The more you lean back on your back foot, the more the wing will tilt upright, 
							creating more lift.
							In the opposite direction, the more applied weight on your front foot, 
							the more the wing will dive underwater.
							Finding your balance is key to controlling the hydrofoil surfboard.

							Who is foil surfing?
						</header>
						<p>
							Foil Surfing just like any other type of surfing can be learned by anybody
							who is willing to and who possess the required equipment. In addition, since the sport can be
							exercised in almost any kind of weather and current, it's easily accesible to anybody at any time.

							Companies who provide foil surfing
						</header>
						<p>
							If you are looking for a compact and buoyant foil surfboard, 
							you will love the Slingshot Sports High Roller. Its buoyancy makes paddling 
							works like a breeze, and its compact design makes it fast and responsive as your foil.
							Its S-rail is high in volume; that is why you can paddle it comfortably even if it is not
							bulky in size. The deck is concave that provides leverage to the toes and heels that makes
							carving and turning an easy task.
							Because of its compact design, traveling with it is not much of an issue. 
							It has carbon reinforcements that give added support and strength to the strategic 
							board parts. The underside has chined rails that prevent edge setting and provide
							more accessible release from water when you foil.

							Future of foil surfing
						</header>
						<p>
							Over the next few years, we will see more and more people discover the benefits of foil 
							surfing and maybe one day it will be very commonplace. It will be a stepping stone into 
							the sport for many, a great introduction to the world of watersports. I have found that 
							those who enjoy the challenge and thrill of riding this board are in it for the full 
							experience and will slowly get used to this new skill. They may choose to carry on surfing 
							other types of boards and then come back to their foils when they think they have become good
							enough.
